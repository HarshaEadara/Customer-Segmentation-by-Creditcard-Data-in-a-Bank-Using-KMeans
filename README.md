## Overview
Customer segmentation is a key process in marketing and customer relationship management, allowing businesses to identify distinct groups of customers and tailor their strategies accordingly. This project utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their credit card usage data.

Key steps include:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA (if needed)
- Implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm
- Visualizing and interpreting the clusters

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains anonymized customer credit card data, which includes features such as:
- Customer ID
- Annual Spending
- Transaction Frequencies
- Credit Limit
- Balance Payments

> **Note:** The dataset used in the notebook is provided within the `data` folder, which is obtained from Kaggle.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Normalizing the data
   - Removing outliers (if necessary)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding feature distributions
   - Visualizing correlations and trends

3. **Clustering:**
   - Applying the K-Means algorithm
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method or Silhouette score

4. **Visualization:**
   - Visualizing clusters in 2D/3D space
   - Analyzing key characteristics of each cluster

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshaEadara/Customer-Segmentation-by-Creditcard-Data-in-a-Bank-Using-KMeans.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd Customer-Segmentation-by-Creditcard-Data-in-a-Bank-Using-KMeans
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation_by_Creditcard_Data_in_a_Bank_Using_KMeans.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

## Results
The clustering analysis provides insights into distinct customer groups based on their credit card usage patterns. For example:
- High-spending, low-frequency customers
- Low-spending, high-frequency customers
- Balanced users with average spending and frequency

These insights can help banks tailor their marketing campaigns and improve customer service strategies.
